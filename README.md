# IMPC-DRï¼šInfinite-horizon Model Predictive Control with Deadlock Resolution
code for article: Recursive Feasibility and Deadlock Resolution in MPC-based Multi-robot Trajectory Generation

IMPC-DR is a online replanning method for multi-robot which can achieve the recursive feasibility when solving optimization problems during replanning in addition to its capibility that resolving deadlock problem in cluttered enviroment.

Here we provide a python3-based app which can simulate the trasition for multi-robot in free space in 2D and 3D. Since the we can gurantee the feasibility of convex programming in replanning, the high reliability can be expressed by this APP.

## General Setup

We have tested our code with:
`ubuntu 18.0.4/20.0.4`
in python3

This APP need following dependencies:
```
PyQt5          5.15.1
opencv-python  4.1.2.30
numpy          1.19.2
mosek          9.4.20
cvxpy          1.1.6
scipy          1.5.3
matplotlib     3.4.3
```
Beiseds, you need to install libxcb-xinerama0 as follows:
`sudo apt-get install libxcb-xinerama0`

For `mosek`, you need a license to use it. How to get an offical license can refer to [mosek](https://www.mosek.com/ "mosek")

## Running App

In `2D` or `3D` file:
python3 app.py

You can get following interface:

First, you need to set the number of robots. Then, you can either input the initial position by yourself or get them randomly by press the button 'random initial state'. It is worth noting that if you input the initial state please gurantee that the initial position is collision free and you'd better choose a zero initial velocity. In addition, there has some other efficients which includes time step `h`, length of horizon `K` and minimum radius `r_min` and width of warnning band `episilon`. After seting all above, press `Solve` to calculate the trajectories and, wait for a moment, can obtain it and press `start annimation` to show it. You can also press `Save annimation` to save this annimation and the video will be stored in this file named as 'result01.avi'. Then, press `save trajectory`, you can obtain the following figure as 'trajectory.svg'. For an example, the following picture in our article:

At last, we provide a gif to show how to manipulat this `APP`:
